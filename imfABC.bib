@article{Hillenbrand1998,
	Abstract = {We use optical and near-infrared star counts to explore the structure and dynamics of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). This very young (<1 Myr) cluster is not circularly symmetric in projection but is elongated north-south in a manner similar to the molecular gas distribution in the region, suggesting that the stellar system may still reflect the geometry of the protocluster cloud. Azimuthally averaged stellar source counts compare well with simple spherically symmetric, single-mass King cluster models. The model fits suggest that the inner Trapezium region should be regarded as the core of the ONC, not as a distinct entity as sometimes advocated. We estimate that the core radius of the cluster is 0.16-0.21 pc and that the central stellar density approaches 2 × 10 4 stars pc -3 . Adopting the stellar velocity dispersion from published proper-motion studies, virial equilibrium would require a total mass within about 2 pc of the Trapezium of ~4500 M ☉ , slightly more than twice the mass of the known stellar population and comparable to the estimated mass in molecular gas projected onto the same region of the sky. If ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 20% of the remaining molecular gas is converted into stars, thus adding to the binding mass, given that the present stellar population alone has a total energy close to zero, the ONC is likely to produce a gravitationally bound cluster. The ONC also exhibits mass segregation, with the most massive (Trapezium) stars clearly concentrated toward the center of the cluster and some evidence for the degree of central concentration to decrease with decreasing mass down to 1-2 M ☉ , as would be expected for general mass segregation. Given the extreme youth of the stars compared with the estimated range of collisional relaxation times, the mass segregation is unlikely to be the result of cluster relaxation. Instead, we suggest that the mass segregation reflects a preference for higher mass stars to form in dense, central cluster regions.},

abstract = "Preferential attachment is widely recognised as the principal driving force behind the evolution of many growing networks, and measuring the extent to which it occurs during the growth of a network is important for explaining its overall structure. Conventional methods require that the timeline of a growing network is known, that is, the order in which the nodes of the network appeared in time is available. But growing network datasets are commonly accompanied by missing-timelines, in which instance the order of the nodes in time cannot be readily ascertained from the data. To address this shortcoming, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for measuring preferential attachment in growing networks with missing-timelines. Key to our approach is that any growing network model gives rise to a probability distribution over the space of networks. This enables a growing network model to be fitted to a growing network dataset with missing-timeline, allowing not only for the prevalence of preferential attachment to be estimated as a model parameter, but the timeline also. Parameter estimation is achieved by implementing a novel Metropolis‚ÄìHastings sampling scheme for updating both the preferential attachment parameter and timeline. A simulation study demonstrates that our method accurately measures the occurrence of preferential attachment in networks generated according to the underlying model. What is more, our approach is illustrated on a small sub-network of the United States patent citation network. Since the timeline for this example is in fact known, we are able to validate our approach against the conventional methods, showing that they give mutually consistent estimates."

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},
